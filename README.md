# limeka editor

- this is a port of a port([Waqar144/lite-odin](https://github.com/Waqar144/lite-odin)) of [rxi/lite](https://github.com/rxi/lite)
- It uses [`umka`](https://github.com/vtereshkov/umka-lang) instead of Lua
- most of the odin code is exact copy from `lite-odin`
- i did this to mostly learn umka
